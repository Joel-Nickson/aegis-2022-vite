                    Here's a new level of awesomeness right on the horizon. And on 30th April in first, is
                    where it's all going to go down. Right at Aegis 2.0!!! As a brainchild of the smart,
                    hardworking, and fun-loving students of the mechanical department FISAT, it
                    would be silly to expect anything less than what people have come to expect from
                    us. Aegis2.0 is one of the most prestigious technical fests around the corner.
                    Coming from the same place which has given birth to talent in science,
                    engineering, innovation, and sports, from one of the most rated self-financing
                    colleges, aegis 2.0 is one of the finest events in the state. Yes, welcome to the oneday cultural and techno extravaganza

                    Aegis 2.0 is a national wide technical fest for mechanical engineering students all
                    over india conducted by students of fisat. The event consists of different types of
                    technical events and workshops. The main purpose of this fest is to bring students
                    from different colleges in india to participate in events and make learning fun and
                    better.
